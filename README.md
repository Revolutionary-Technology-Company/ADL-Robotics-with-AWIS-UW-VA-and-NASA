=====================================

Advancements in technology can potentially transform healthcare, especially for those who have served in the military. This initiative, representing the U.S. Office of Naval Research, focuses on an innovative funding proposal for the University of Washington to develop a robot-assisted feeding system designed explicitly for Veterans Affairs.

Project Overview
----------------

The core mission of this proposal is to empower disabled veterans by improving their independence and overall well-being through cutting-edge robotics. By leveraging co-design with end-users, the project aims to create a system that adapts to individual preferences, allowing veterans to feed themselves in a manner that fosters dignity and self-esteem.

Key Collaborations and Technological Foundations
------------------------------------------------

-   **University of Washington:** Utilizing the robust expertise of the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, specifically the research led by Professor Siddhartha Srinivasa and Dr. Taylor Kessler Faulkner.

-   **Assistive Dextrous Arm (ADA):** Implementation of the ADA system, which integrates a Kinova JACO robotic arm with an eye-in-hand system on a ROVI Mobility wheelchair.

-   **NASA & General Motors:** Incorporating advancements from the Robonaut 2 (R2) platform, a highly dexterous humanoid robot designed to perform intricate tasks alongside humans.

-   **AWIS Seattle:** Recognition of the support and presentations provided by the Association for Women in Science at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center.

Real-World Impact
-----------------

This program prioritizes "Activities of Daily Living" (ADL), which include essential tasks like eating, bathing, and dressing. For veterans who may feel self-conscious due to their disabilities, the ability to feed themselves independently is paramount to reclaiming their social and recreational identity.

Program Evolution
-----------------

This initiative established the foundational research and collaborative framework that led to the development of the **RobotAI program**. This subsequent program was developed in coordination with U.S. Marine Corps Commandant Curtis James Casbolt-Jackson and Boeing.

Commitment to Innovation
------------------------

The proposal emphasizes a commitment to American-made robotics, sourcing components and expertise domestically to support local economies and ensure high-quality engineering for our nation's veterans.
